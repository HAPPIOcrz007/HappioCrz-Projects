this week was amazing from 18/07/2025 to 23/07/2025

ðŸ“˜ CS50 Week 2: Arrays

- Introduced to arrays, a data structure for storing sequences of values.
- Learned how arrays are stored in contiguous memory and how to access elements using indices.
- Explored strings as arrays of characters (char[]), terminated with the null character ('\0').
- Worked with standard library functions like strlen, strcmp, strcpy, and others from <string.h>.
- Understood command-line arguments using int argc and string argv[] to accept inputs from the terminal.
- Discussed how strings are pointers to the first character in memory and how characters can be accessed
  and manipulated.
  Reinforced abstraction through function reuse and writing cleaner, modular C code.
