ðŸš€ CS50 Week 3: Algorithms
Covered from 24/07/2025 to 30/07/2025

ðŸ“˜ Main Topics:
- Searching Algorithms:
- Linear Search: simple but inefficient for large datasets.
- Binary Search: efficient O(log n) method for sorted data.
- Visualized time complexity comparisons.
- Sorting Algorithms:
- Selection Sort: find the smallest, place it first. Repeatedly.
- Bubble Sort: swap adjacent elements until sorted.
- Insertion Sort: insert each element into its correct place in the sorted part of the array.
- Compared all three in terms of time complexity:
- Worst-case: O(nÂ²)
- Best-case: O(n) for insertion sort (already sorted)
- Algorithm Analysis:
    - Introduction to Big O notation and performance benchmarking.
    - Analyzed time complexity and tradeoffs in real scenarios.

ðŸ”§ Skills Developed:
- Improved problem-solving by breaking down logic into reusable steps.
- Practiced reading, writing, and debugging algorithms from scratch.
- Learned to optimize both correctness and efficiency.

Worked more with command-line input, building programs that accept arrays via argv.

ðŸ§  Mindset Shift:
- From "make it work" â†’ "make it efficient".
- Learned that not all correct solutions are equal â€” performance matters.

âœ¨ Reflection:
This week built confidence in understanding how data moves through memory and how to control that flow efficiently using clean, optimized algorithms. Sorting isn't just academic â€” it's the core of real-world systems.

âœ… Milestone Completed:

Finished Week 3 Lecture

Implemented Tideman (Ranked Pairs) Voting System
â†’ Passed all check50 and style50 tests ðŸŽ‰

More to come. Loving the challenge.
See you in Week 4.

*had to use* **ai** *to understand what is tideman for some reason i wasn't able to understand what cs50 meant by tideman , i had some questions regarding functionality , i used ai to understand .. all questions are answered by me .. but again i am still confused with tideman .. after clearing my doubts i will retry tideman with merge sorting and a better & efficient* **lock_pair** *code*
**so sorry for inconvinience if you have any reading my tideman code**-->
i will update it once my concepts are much clearer-->
THANK YOU
