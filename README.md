# 🎮 Project: Gravity Flip

A fast-paced side-scrolling game built in Python using Pygame. Designed in two days of intense coding and iteration.

## Features

* **Speed scaling**: Game speed increases automatically as the player's score rises, forcing quicker reactions.
* **Player animations**: Smooth running, jumping, and upside-ground animations for a more alive feel.
* **Screen shake**: Triggered on falling events to add impact and feedback.
* **Dynamic themes**: Game visuals change based on in-game conditions to keep the look fresh.
* **Custom assets**: Entire game uses hand-made sprites for player, platforms, and ground surfaces.

## Files

* [`main.py`](./Project-Gravity_Flip/main.py): Game loop, physics, animations, scoring.
* [`assets/`](./Project-Gravity_Flip/assets): Sprites used for movement, surfaces, planks, jumping frames.
* [`scores.json`](./Project-Gravity_Flip/scores.json): Stores high scores.
* [`requirements.txt`](./Project-Gravity_Flip/requirements.txt): Dependencies.
